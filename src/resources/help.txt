The HxTiger program is used to view or edit a file.

This program is different from other Hex Editor programs in the following ways:

	- Does not load the complete file into memory before displaying.
	  * It loads 200 blocks at a time.  This means you can edit/view any size file.
	- The file is broke up into 16 or 32 byte blocks. Select the block size
	  * before opening the file.
	- The section just above the hex dump area of the page is the navigation
	  * section for the file.
	  + Use the mouse on the slider to select a position in the file.
	  + Or click on a position in the slider to move to that position.
	  + Use the arrow keys to increase or decrease the file position by one.
	  + Use the text field to enter a block number to goto. Press Enter to move.
	- The number at the end of the slider is the total number of blocks in file.
	- Right click any line for an edit menu.
	
	- The section just below the hex dump area is for searching.
	- Editing the file is done in real time with the origin file, so any changes
	  * made, changes the file directly.
	- To edit a block, right click it and select 'Edit' from the popup menu.
	- You can have multiple files open at once.  Each file has its own tab.

To Open a file use the File->Open File menu option or Ctrl-O.

The Search box below the hex dump area is for searching the file and finding all matches.
The search pattern has to be in 2 digit hex format with a space separator.
Example: df ff 01 0a

Use Ctrl-Q to close and quit the HxTiger program.

I hope you find the programs useful.
